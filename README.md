## Getting started

### Running the project

#### Requirements
See the [authentication](./docs/AUTHENTICATION.md) instructions before you continue.

#### With Docker  

1. Clone the project.
2. Run `cp .env.example .env` and add the environment variables to it
3. Run `sh scripts/dev.sh` to start the Docker container
4. Access http://localhost:6060

#### Without Docker

1. Clone the project
2. Run `cp .env.example .env` and add the environment variables to it
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Start the dev server `npm run start:dev`  
4. Access http://localhost:6060

### How this project is structured

Basic rules:

1. All components live in the `src/components` folder.
2. Only components that will be exported should be directly child of `src/components`, any component for internal use should be inside the component using it.
3. All components being exported should have a `README.md` file inside its folder, it should display examples of how to use the component.


The full folder structure of this library is explained below:

| Name                                             | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **.vscode**                                      | Contains VS Code specific settings.                                                   |
| **dist**                                         | Contains the distributable from the Webpack build.                                    |
| **src**                                          | Contains the source code.                                                             |
| **src/assets**                                   | Contains the assets used by the components (images, general stylesheets).             |
| [**src/components**](src/components/README.md)   | Contains the components based on the Design System                                    |
| **styleguide**                                   | Build files generated by the style guide tool.                                        |
| [**tests**](tests/README.md)                     | Contains the tests                                                                    |


## Scripts

We have a set of useful Shell scripts in this project in order to speedup the development.

### Shell Scripts
- `scripts/buildDocs.sh`: Builds the Docker image with the styleguidist docs.
- `scripts/dockerTagDocs.sh`: Runs the buildDocs process and sends the image to Docker Hub.
- `scripts/dev.sh`: Runs the Docker container and after starts the app.

## Publish a new version
