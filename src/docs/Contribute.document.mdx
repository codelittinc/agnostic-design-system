# Before Getting Started

This section covers the standard to be followed whenever creating the documentation for any of the three different types of components
used in the Agnostic Design System:

| Component Type |                        Description                        |         Example          |
| :------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|     Simple     |                    a single component                     |      Button, Input       |
|   Decorator    |   adds aditional functionalities to a Simple component    | NumericInput, EmailInput |
|   Composite    | composed of multiple Simple/Decorators in its composition |           List           |

As an **IMPORTANT OBSERVATION**: whenever a component is updated, whether by adding an additional property, updating a CSS
variable or any other alteration, it is imperative to also update the respective documentation of that component.

# Standard Convention

The objective of each documentation file is to clarify the functionality of the component in question. The key goal is
to be as clear as possible as to avoid directly referencing the code. As such, each documentation file should contain
at least the following subsections: **Component** and **Variables Available**. <br /><br />
If additional subsections are required to accurately relay the requirements or more important information, you should feel
free to do so. However, please keep in mind the maintenance of the present template.

## Component

This subsection should contain a table that comprises information on the properties of the component, as well as
general information of the component itself.<br />
The table should be comprised of five columns, each with the respective title indicating: the property name,
the type of the property, the description of the component, the default value of the property (if is has one)
and whether or not it is a mandatory property.

#### Decorator component cases:

Given the nature of the decorator component, be sure to also reference the component which it also draws other properties from through a simple observation with a link to that component.

### Example

|    Prop    |      Type       |                                                                                     Description                                                                                      | Default | Mandatory |
| :--------: | :-------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----: | :-------: |
| appendIcon | React.ReactNode | By default it receives an Arrow Icon, but it is possible to send your own Icon. The Icon can also be the only element inside the button, if there isn't a value passed to the label. |    -    |   false   |
|  onClick   |   () => void    |                                                                                          -                                                                                           |  true   |   true    |

Additionally, this subsection should also contain a **Getting Started** space demonstrating the import and utilization of the component in a project.<br />
Be sure to also include any other information pertinent to the composition of the component, such as **differing categories** and/or **sizes**, as is the case with
the Button Component's [documentation](https://design-system.codelitt.dev/?path=/docs/components-button--neutral).

#### Decorator component cases:

Given the nature of the decorator component, in addition to displaying its own properties, be sure to also reference the
component which it also draws other properties from through a simple observation with a link to that component.
For instance, this is being reflected in the [NumericInput's documentation](https://design-system.codelitt.dev/?path=/docs/components-numeric-input--default).

## CSS Variables Available

Before moving forward, please be sure to refer the [general convention documentation](https://design-system.codelitt.dev/?path=/docs/welcome-customizing-styles--page) in the Welcome Section.
This documentation showcases the naming format currently being employed in the project to configure our CSS variables. <br />

This subsection should contain a table that comprises information on all the CSS variables currently being employed in the component. <br />
The table should be comprised of three columns, each with the respective title indicating: the property, the attribute and the available states.

As an important observation, be sure to coordinate with the Agnostic Design System team on the necessary amount of CSS variables
a component should have. Although flexibility and freedom in customization is an important aspect in development, too much can
be an issue. We would like to avoid polluting CSS files with excessive variables.

### Example - Button Component

|  Property   |    Attribute     |                  State                   |
| :---------: | :--------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|             | background-color |           hover, focus, active           |
|             |  border-bottom   | hover, focus, active, positive, negative |
| action-icon | background-color |                                          |
| action-icon |      color       |              hover, active               |

This relays that a developer with the intent of changing the button component's background color would do

#### Composite component cases:

Given the nature of the composite component, be sure to also add a table for the variables utilized in the child component being drawn into
the parent component. For example, the [List](https://design-system.codelitt.dev/?path=/docs/components-list--simple-list) component utilizes
the ListItem component in its architecture as well. Therefore, its own variables should be listed out.
