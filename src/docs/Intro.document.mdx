# Codelitt's Agnostic Design System

Our design system is meant to act as the backbones of simple projects at Codelitt.

## Warning!

We do not guarantee backwards compability! It will be of responsibility of each project to guarantee
you are importing a specific version!

### How to install

Getting your Github Token

1. Access your [tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Create a token that can read registry packages

### Inside the project folder:

1. Set up an `.npmrc` file and add the following lines:

```
@codelittinc:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/codelittinc
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${YOUR_TOKEN}
```

Observation: Please keep in mind the token is **private**! As a standard and security safe
practice, be sure to add the `npmrc` file as a rule in `gitignore`.

2. run: `npm install @codelittinc/agnostic-design-system`
3. add `import '@codelittinc/agnostic-design-system/dist/main.css'` to your `App.js` (or `App.tsx` file if your project is using TypeScript)
### Importing a component

`import { Button, Row, Container, Col } from '@codelittinc/agnostic-design-system';`
